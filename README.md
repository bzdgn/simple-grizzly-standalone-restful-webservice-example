Simple Grizzly Standalone Restful Webservice Example
====================================================
This project is a demonstration and example for a standalone grizzly RESTful webservice application.
It is a customer-api that you can apply the basic CRUD operations. For the 'customer' model, 
a simple POJO with dot-notation is introduced. An interface Repository is used to generalize
and set a contract for any arbitrary Repository Implementation to be used in the project.
A simple static ArrayList is used in the Cache Repository Implementation but you can use
any arbitrary repository implementing the interface contract like Database Implementation,
File Implementation, Socket Implementation and so on.

I've used a Configuration Manager, which that I've previously implemented and also you can check
[github repository](https://github.com/bzdgn/singleton-configuration-manager-example/blob/master/README.md). I've explained the Configuration Manager on the independent repository
in detail.

To demonstrate the Front Controller, I've created a [CustomerController class](https://github.com/bzdgn/simple-grizzly-standalone-restful-webservice-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/levent/webservice/controller/impl/CustomerController.java) and applied basic
HTTP Methods like GET (for single and collection retrieve), POST (for create), PUT (for update) 
and DELETE (for delete).
